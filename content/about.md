My name is Silvia. I am a biologist who discovered a passion for programming and decided to turn it into a career. Back in 2020, while I was doing my MSc in Statistics, I joined the Genomic Medicine research group as an intern. During this time, I developed R scripts for data wrangling and cleaning. Shortly after the pandemic lockdown ended in Spain, I became a research technician for the largest national project studying the genetic basis of COVID-19 (the SCOURGE project), which was awarded to my principal investigator.

In 2021, after completing my master’s, I decided to turn my research into a PhD, which I defended in June 2024 with a _Cum Laude_ distinction. During my PhD, I led studies for the SCOURGE consortium, focusing on identifying genetic determinants of COVID-19. This involved collaborating with over 30 research centers across Spain and Latin America. Boucing between biostatistics and bioinformatics (with a stronger focus on biostatistics), I spent a lot of time working with large-scale genetic and clinical data. My supervisors gave me a lot of freedom to design and run analyses, which meant I got to explore, experiment, make mistakes and learn at my own pace.  Half of my research focused on discovering genetic variants and genes linked to COVID-19 severity, while the other half evaluated polygenic risk scores as biomarkers for complex diseases. I also explored how these scores performed in diverse populations and their potential utility in clinical settings compared to non-genetic factors.

Since I enjoy staying busy and our team was small, I took on additional projects. Some involved assisting with analyses, while others allowed me to lead the planning and execution. These experiences taught me how to work in interdisciplinary teams, write detailed reports for external researchers, and manage remote collaborations. After finishing my PhD, I took some time to ponder my next steps. While I loved research, I decided to move into the pharmaceutical industry—and I’m currently looking for my next opportunity!

Now, since this is an _about me_ section and not my CV, here are a few personal facts:

1. I read a lot. Some of my favorite books are The Maniac (Benjamin Labatut), White Teeth (Zadie Smith), and Cleaned Out (Annie Ernaux).

2. I have a very funny rescue dog named Cora who loves rolling in the dirt and requires daily baths.

3. I practice Iyengar Yoga.

4. I’m the person my friends turn to for household management advice.

5. I enjoy keeping up with fashion and tech drama.
