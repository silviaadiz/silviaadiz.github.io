Hi!

My name is Silvia. I am a biologist who once discovered how much she enjoyed programming and statistics and decided to turn that into her job. In 2020, while doing my MSc in statistics, I joined the Genomic Medicine research group as an intern, during which I developed R scripts for data wrangling and cleansing. Right after finishing the pandemics lockdown in Spain, I became a research technician for the largest national project to study the genetic basis of COVID-19 (project SCOURGE), awarded to my PI. 

After finishing my master's degree, in 2021, I decided to turn that research into a PhD, which I earned with Cum Laude mention in June 2024. During that time, I led the studies for the SCOURGE consortium, focused on discovering genetic determinants of the disease. Bouncing between biostatistics and bioinformatics, I worked both on large-scale genetic and clinical data. My supervisors trusted me with the design and execution of several of the analyses in the project, allowing me to fail and to succeed
